To update replace the core folder with the new version, then make sure everything
compiles correctly.

**Warning!** Do not delete or edit Core files unless you are debugging, updating or contributing to [Essentials](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials). Use [custom](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/custom) for adding extra modules.
